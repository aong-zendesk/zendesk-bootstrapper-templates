Browse here for all the available templates or build you own templates!

## How to use Zendesk Bootstrapper

2. Type `help` and follow through the instructions

Thats it! Its _beautifully simple_, just like Zendesk.

## Don't see the Bootstrapper Template that fit your needs? Create one !
1. Browse under the folder `master-template` which contains the entire feature set that Zendesk Bootstrapper supports
2. Analyze the JSON structure
3. Formulate your own template!

PS: It supports *ALL* values of the Zendesk APIs (you could refer to https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/support/introduction for more details). So you could use values that you don't see within the `master-template` within each functionality.
